## Overview

W.Avy has a surf shop that he plans on opening in Oahu, Hawaii. Before he opens, he would like temperature data for the month of June (summer) and December (winter) in order to determine if he should be open year-round. This will define what risk he will be encountering if he decides to operate seasonally. 


## Results

3 Key differences between the weather in the month of June and December are:

  - The amount of days that were collected. June has a count of 1700 meanwhile December has a count of 1517. The difference between the two is 183, which can change the stats of the temperatures depending of the climate during that time 

  - The minimum temperate is also vital information. There is not a significant difference between June and December, meaning that the customers will not feel discouraged to be outside for the day. 
  
  - The average temperature between the two months are right under 4Â°F. The comparism shows that the temperature in Oahu, Hawaii during the winter and the summer are not significantly different, and therfore he should be able to operate his surf and ice cream shop year-round. This information is vital to helping W.Avy make a decision moving forward

## Summary

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

With all the information gather, oragnized and displayed, it is fair to say the business should be operating year-round. The risk and cost of closing seasonaly would be more than remaining open all year, except for major holidays. 

Other queries that should be performed to gather more weather data for June and December, should be precipitation and natural disasters. Considering that Hawaii is a tropical island, the other types of climates should be considered. I would recommend gathering the number of days each year have rainfall or natural disasters, how much rainfall, and the average of both. 
Although Oaho does have two volcanos on the island, both have not erupted in over 35,000 years. The possibility of eruption is very slim, but should always be considered.

In addition to that, the cost of goods is an essential part of the business. Hawaii is an island and imports/exports are a major resource for its inhabitants. After estimating how many days a year you might be closed vs the cost of goods, having all the information can contribute to my analysis or change my recommendation entirely.
